# AI-Legal-Assistant-Summarize-Court-Orders-Using-LangChain-Gemini-with-FAISS-Search-Hugging-Face

This project leverages powerful AI models and vector search technology to analyze and summarize court orders from publicly accessible PDFs. It automatically extracts key information such as case titles, petitioner/respondent names, and important points from legal documents using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## üìÑ How It Works

1. **Load Court Order PDF**  
   Downloads a court order from a URL and splits the content into pages.

2. **Embed & Index**  
   Uses HuggingFace embeddings to convert text into vector format and indexes them using FAISS for fast retrieval.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   Combines the FAISS retriever with a prompt template and Google Gemini model to generate concise legal summaries.

4. **Query Execution**  
   Asks the model to extract and present key legal information, including case title, petitioner, and defendant.
